# Temperature-with-renesas-CS-IDE
In this repo, I implemented the code and built a program to retrieve data from the ADT7410 temperature sensor and display it on the LCD screen via SPI method. Besides, it also uses UART to transmit data to the PC via Tera team. In addition, the project has many other requirements, please read the project design and documents I have on this Repo.
