; [Sample of Link Directive File]
; *************************************************************
; Link Directive File is created by users when memory or segment
; location needs to be changed from the default as the following
; cases, for instance:
;    1. In case the stack area should be in fixed area
;    2. In case the external memory should be used
;
; Please change the start address, the size of memory, 
; and the name of memory or segment according to your system,
; and link this file with -D linker option if necessary.
;
;   MEMORY directive : Declares an address in installed memory.
;                      Devides memory into two or more areas and
;                      specifies a memory area
;   MERGE directive  : Specifies location of a segment
; *************************************************************

; <Example on how to specify the stack area>
;  Please specify the linker option -SSTK.
;  The stack area should be in the internal RAM area.
;
;      START ADDRESS, STACK SIZE
;memory STK : ( 0FB000H, 100H )
; <Example of locating data in external memory>
; The section name output by C compiler can be changed with
; #pragma section function.
;
; If the name of ROMization-related section which has global
; variables with initial values is changed, the modification of
; C start-up routine will be required. 
; Please refer the CC78K0R C Compiler Language User's Manual 
; Language Chap.11 in detail.
;
; ex. This is the example of renaming the @@DATAL segment.
;   #pragma section @@DATAL EXTDATA
;
;   By the following directives, "EXTDATA" segment is located in EXMEM area.
;
;        START ADDRESS, MEMORY SIZE
